            <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a roasting rack on a foil-lined baking sheet in the oven.</li>
            <li>Using your hands, break the meat into small pieces and combine 
                evenly but loosely on a parchment or waxed paper-lined Daking sheet. Spread the meat out and season it generously with salt and pepper. If desired, add the spice mix at this time.</li>
            <li>Divide the meat into 4 portions (about 6 ounces each). Using your hands, form each portion into a ball-shape by gently tossing it from 1 hand to the other. (Don't over work or press too firmly on the meat.) Gently form each portion into a patty about 3 1/2 inches wide and 1-inch thick</li>
            <li>Preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.
                Raise the heat to high and add the oil. Add the patties and cook, turning once, until well-browned, about 2 minutes each side.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, transfer the hamburgers to the roasting rack in the oven and continue cooking to desired doneness, 8 to 9 minutes for medium-rare, 10 to 11 minutes for medium, and 13 to 15 minutes for well-done. If you are using the cheese, top the hamburgers during their last couple of minutes of cooking to melt.</li>
            <li>Transfer the hamburgers to a plate, let rest for a couple minutes before serving. Meanwhile, toast the hamburger buns. Assemble the hamburgers with the condiments and toppings of your choice.
                Serve.</li>
            <li>When cooking on a countertop grill, turn on grill, then place burgers on the heated grill.</li>
            <h4>Time for a countertop grill</h4>
            <li>For Medium-Rare: Cook for 3 minutes covered and then unplug the machine and continue to cook covered for 2 to 3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>For Medium: Cook for 4 minutes covered and then unplug the machine and continue to cook covered for 4 more minutes.</li>
            <li>For Well: Cook for 5 minutes covered and then unplug the machine</li>
            </ol>
